# Predicting World Cup Match Winners

This is a hacked together example of using a KNN classifier to predict winners of soccer matches based on a team and their opponents' [SPIs](https://www.espn.com/world-cup/story/_/id/4447078/ce/us/guide-espn-spi-ratings).


Data used is modified from 2014 and 2018 worldcup predictions published on [five thirty eight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/interactives/world-cup/).  Data lives in the `combined_datasets.csv` file found at `app/public/`.

## Setup

`cd app`

`npm install`

`npm start`
