# Predicting World Cup Match Winners

This is a hacked together example of a KNN classifier being used to predict winners of soccer matches.  Featured used are home and opposing teams' [SPIs](https://www.espn.com/world-cup/story/_/id/4447078/ce/us/guide-espn-spi-ratings).


Data used is modified from 2014 and 2018 worldcup predictions published on [five thirty eight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/interactives/world-cup/).  Data lives in the `combined_datasets.csv` file found at `app/public/`.
